## Exercise I
# comment to commit
a)
a = 0  is a single operation = O(1)
while (a < n * n * n) is n^3 = O(n^3)
a = a + n * n     is n^2     = O(n^2)

In other cases we've looked at the bigger of values for Big O dominate, but in this case if you check n = [1, 2, 3, 10] because a is increasing by n^2 at the same time that while is n^3 the rate of growth is just n.


b)


c)
